# Component Library

This directory contains various components that are generic to the project, and are used, or will potentially be used, in more than one component directory.

Some generic components that are *not* in this directory:

+ `login/CheckLogin.svelte`
+ the `icons` directory

I am unsure if these (particularly the first) should be moved to this directory.
